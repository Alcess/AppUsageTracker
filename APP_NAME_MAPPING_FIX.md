# App Name Mapping - Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
The app was displaying package names (like `com.facebook.katana`) instead of user-friendly names (like `Facebook`) in various places, even though some mappings existed.

## Root Cause
Multiple different app name mapping implementations existed across the codebase:
- `AppUsageService` relied on Android native code for app names
- `FCMService` had a small mapping (only 10 apps)
- `ParentDashboardScreen` had a large mapping (100+ apps)
- No centralized system was in place

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Centralized App Name Mapper
**File:** `lib/utils/app_name_mapper.dart`
- Contains **180+ app mappings** including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.
- Organized by categories: Social Media, Gaming, Video, Shopping, etc.
- Single source of truth for all app name conversions

### 2. Updated All Services to Use Central Mapping

**AppUsageService** (`lib/services/app_usage_service.dart`):
- Now applies centralized mapping to all usage statistics
- Prioritizes mapped names over raw Android app names

**FCMService** (`lib/services/fcm_service.dart`):
- Removed small local mapping
- Now uses centralized mapping for Firebase commands

**ParentDashboardScreen** (`lib/screens/parent_dashboard_screen.dart`):
- Removed large local mapping
- Now uses centralized mapping for Firebase usage data

**ChildUsageViewScreen** (`lib/screens/child_usage_view_screen.dart`):
- Added proper app name mapping for usage events

## Apps Now Properly Named

### Social Media
- `com.facebook.katana` → **Facebook**
- `com.facebook.orca` → **Messenger**
- `com.instagram.android` → **Instagram**
- `com.tiktok.android` → **TikTok**
- `com.twitter.android` → **Twitter**

### Google Apps
- `com.google.android.gm` → **Gmail**
- `com.google.android.youtube` → **YouTube**
- `com.google.android.apps.maps` → **Google Maps**

### Gaming
- `com.roblox.client` → **Roblox**
- `com.supercell.clashofclans` → **Clash of Clans**
- `com.mojang.minecraftpe` → **Minecraft**

### And 170+ more apps!

## Benefits
- ✅ **Consistent naming** across all app screens
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** of popular apps
- ✅ **Easy maintenance** - single file to update
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - uses const mapping
- ✅ **Future-proof** - easy to add new app mappings

## Usage Statistics Now Show
Instead of: `com.facebook.katana - 45 minutes`
You'll see: **Facebook - 45 minutes**

Your app will now display user-friendly names everywhere instead of confusing package names!
